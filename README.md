# Websocket Client
Websocket Client is a tool to test / debug WebSocket server applications.
<br>
The goal is to provide a way to easily test or debug WebSocket server applications using a variety of protocols.
Currently there is only the [STOMP Message Protocol](https://stomp.github.io/) available, as I currently want to work on some Spring Boot applications with WebSocket.
